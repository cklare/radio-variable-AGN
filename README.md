Hi, here is a repository of the software I wrote to identify AGN with possible young synchrotron jets. The radio data is proprietary, so unless you are part of the VAST collaboration, this software won't be super helpful

File structure -
functions.py : contains every user-defined function called in the main script (self-explanatory, hopefully)
baby_jets_pipeline.py : the main script; requires that the path to the data be changed to run
